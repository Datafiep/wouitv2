[{"name": "Lucas", "message": "Hey community, Lucas here. Wanted to share a quick success story. Last season, I used futures for the first time to hedge about 30% of my crop. When the market unexpectedly turned, I managed to secure a much better price than the spot market. It was a learning curve, but well worth it. Happy to share more about my approach if anyone's interested !\n", "timestamp": "2024-02-02 14:08:00"}, {"name": "Farmer 78", "message": "Hi everyone, it's Mia from Montana.\nThis year's been tough with the drought affecting almost 40% of my yield. \nI hadn't locked in futures as I should have, and now I'm facing lower prices. \nAny advice on damage control? \n", "timestamp": "2024-02-02 14:10:32"}]
